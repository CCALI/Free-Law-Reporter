This is the code that powers the [The Free Law Reporter website](http://www.freelawreporter.org/). It is provided for
reference purposes.

The search engine that powers the FLR is Apache Solr. It is the essential missing piece that is needed to turn this handful of
files into a functioning website. The extra info added to Solr's schema.xml file is containd in solr-schema-example.xml. Further
tuning of Solr is possible and probably a good idea.
